# Adjust Brightness

The Adjust Brightness node modifies the brightness of an input image. It works by multiplying each pixel's value by a specified factor, then clamping the resulting values to stay within a valid range. A factor of 1.0 leaves the image unchanged, values below 1.0 make it darker, and values above 1.0 make it brighter. If the input image has an alpha channel, the alpha channel is passed through unchanged so transparency is preserved.
