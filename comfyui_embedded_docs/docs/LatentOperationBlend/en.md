# Latent Operation Blend

This node creates a latent operation that blends a latent toward a reference latent, and returns that operation so it can be plugged into nodes such as Latent Apply Operation or Latent Apply Operation CFG. When the reference is a different spatial size, it is resized to the target latent with nearest-neighbor interpolation, and a reference with a smaller batch is repeated to match the target batch size. A strength of 0 leaves the latent unchanged. This node is marked as experimental.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Description | Data Type | Required | Range |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `reference` | The latent to blend toward. Its samples are cast to the device and dtype of the latent being processed, then resized and repeated to match it. | LATENT | Yes | - |
| `strength` | How far to blend toward the reference: 0 leaves the latent unchanged, 1 matches the resized reference latent (default: 1.0). | FLOAT | Yes | 0.0 to 1.0 (step 0.0001) |

## Outputs

| Output Name | Description | Data Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `operation` | A blend operation that can be applied to latent samples. | LATENT_OPERATION |
